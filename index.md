## Hey, I'm Finn.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

greeting = "Hello, World!"

def main(arg):
  print(arg)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main(greeting)
```

I'm a scripting hobbyist with an innate desire to pick things apart, if only to reconstruct them again.  While I often make things more difficult than they need to be, that's really just my way of learning the finer details.  I'm continually working to improve my abilities - whether in scripting, home improvement, motorhome repair - and figured I'd share some of my experiences (and work) in hopes that they're of use to others.

## Project statuses

I've always got more going on than I can keep up with, so if anything seems half-baked or completely unfinished... well, it probably is.  Here's what's on the drawing board & where I stand:

 - **finnoybu.github.io:** This is my main site, which I'm building using [mdwiki](http://www.mdwiki.info).  Of course, I don't know much about markdown language, nor about mdwiki, so there's a bit of a learning curve.  For example, half way into the project, I found that [mdwiki is no longer being supported (as of October 27, 2018)](https://github.com/Dynalon/mdwiki/blob/master/README.md).  So there's that.  I'm considering forking the repo & maintaining it myself, but that level of coding might be outside my scope.  Dare I go down that rabbit hole, here's what I'd be interested in doing:
   - Migrating from bootstrap v3 to v5: why start small, right? This would mean excising jquery from the entire project.  I don't know anything about jquery.  Dream big or go home.
   - Creating some new gimmicks, such as a way to display external files in something like a colorbox.  New to both of these things, as well.
   - Possibly removing some of the obfuscation in the compiled HTML.  I get the reason for this, but I like being able to tweak my code & obfuscation is not my friend.
 
 
 - **Digital forensics scripts:** This is a really an offshoot of some of the work I do as a Quality Assurance Engineer for a digital forensics organization & is inspired by the work done by [Eric Zimmerman](https://www.sans.org/profiles/eric-zimmerman/), a well known digital forensics and incident reponse (DFIR) professional who has a skill set way beyond anything I'll ever hope to match.  But that won't stop me from trying.  I'm in the midst of honing my python skills, and this gives me an opportunity to really stretch my knowledge while also helping me develop new tools to use in my day job.

 Tip: If you're interested in DFIR, I strongly suggest checking out [Eric Zimmerman's Tools](https://www.sans.org/tools/ez-tools/) - invaluable assets to have around.

 - **Memoirs of Olavus Vastbo:** A project that's twenty years in the making, with a backstory that's nearly twice as old.  Olavus was my fourth great-grandfather who lived an extraodinary life as a sailor in the Norwegian merchant fleet.  I received a copy of his memoirs in 1999 after I was reunited with my birthmother and family, 33 years after I was adopted.  The manuscript was translated from old Norse to English decades earlier & my copy has been recopied at least three times, so the quality is far from perfect.  In any case, I've struggled to bring the memoirs back to life & publish them on the web for quite some time, and I think I've finally found a framework that will work.  Yes, mdwiki.  No, I don't know what I'm getting myself into.  That's nothing new.

## Other stuff

As if that's not enough, I also spend some of my free time (ha!) playing games with my kids ([Minecraft](https://namemc.com/profile/finnoybu.1), mostly), remodeling our house & thinking about remodeling our RV.  Again... in my free time.  More about those projects later. :)
